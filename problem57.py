# It is possible to show that the square root of two can 
# be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.

# âˆš 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...

# By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:

# 1 + 1/2 							= 3/2	= 1.5
# 1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) 					= 7/5	= 1.4
# 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) 			= 17/12	= 1.41666...
# 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) 	= 41/29	= 1.41379...

# The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, 
# but the eighth expansion, 1393/985, is the first example 
# where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the 
# number of digits in the denominator.

# In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions 
# contain a numerator with more digits than denominator?
