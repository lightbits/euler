# The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, 
# tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

# 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

# By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding 
# to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value.
# For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t_10.
# If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

# Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing
# nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?

############
# Solution #
############

# The longest word is of length 14
# val(Z) * 14 = 390
# The lowest triangle number greater than 390 is t_28
